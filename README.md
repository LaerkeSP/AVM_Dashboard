## Week 8
The design phase has been started, following the CAST method presented in class. Here the Content, Audience, and Story has been worked through, with the Tell part still missing.

The CAST method has been chosen as the design method, as it structures important aspects of the project, as the content is argued for, the audience is analyzed, the story is considered and created, and the design and testing is included.
One important note is however, that the testing would likely not get done, with the projects goal being creating a prototype of the dashboard, but not perfecting it through an iterative testing phase.

The report is now further in the works, with the CAST method added to the structure, and the general notes and conclusions to the Content, Audience, and Story, being written down. 
The Content and Audience part was largely decided in week 7, although has now been further explored and argued. This has also led to a change in the audience, with them now being:
- Wes Streeting MP: Secretary of State for Health and Social Care
- ED Miliband MP: Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero
- Louise Haigh MP: Secretary of State for Transport

This change was made, as Steve Reed (Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) was responsible for the import of food, instead of the production of it, limiting his relevance. Instead Louise Haigh has been added, as her influence on both public and private transport, could have a great interest.

Further work for week 9 is to start the brainstorming and design process, so that everything is ready for the creation of the dashboard. 


# Week 7
In this week the main area of focus has been chosen. This was partially done through a class discussion, and a seminar.

The area of focus is within healthcare, and focuses on the effects of air pollution from climate change on peoples health.
Here lung cancer, respiratory diseases, and heart diseases are the main focus, as they seem to be the main healthcare problems affected by air pollution (See How can air pollution cause cancer?).

Additionally, data gathering has started, where the air pollution dataset and the cancer datasets has been found, with the next step being finding data on respiratory diseases, and heart diseases.

The data is collected from all of the UK with it being subdivided into the regions. This is primarily with the goal to see the changes in the individual areas.
The beneficiaries and audience of the dashboard are specific ministers of the government, as they are the ones who would be able to regulate the energy market, healthcare, and farming.
Ministers/secretaries:
- Wes Streeting MP: Secretary of State for Health and Social Care
- Ed Miliband MP: Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero
- Steve Reed OBE MP: Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs

The paper itself has also been started, with the bare structure now in place. A general plan for the project has also been created to ensure ample time to create the dashboard.
